* Readme
My Emacs configuration files mostly, but also some other useful config files 

** Compiling

  I am unsure how recent an emacs you need to be able to run these files, but they are working 
  for me on 24.5

  To run this script run the following command:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
    emacs --script build.el
  #+END_SRC
